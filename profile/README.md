# [RUR Robotics](https://rurrobotics.com/)

 We build reliable, efficient robots and aim to improve our skills with each competition. We work as a team, communicate openly, and take responsibility for our designs. Precision, curiosity, and dedication guide everything we do. 

 ## History

 We began as a small robotics team at Gymnasium Jovan Jovanović Zmaj, later continuing our work at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering. Over the past three years, we’ve competed at Eurobot, growing our skills, our team, and the quality of our robots each season.
